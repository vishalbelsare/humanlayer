# ENG-1758: GitHub Actions Caching Implementation Progress

## Objective
Implement caching for Go and Rust dependencies in GitHub Actions workflows to reduce build times and meet the mandatory February 1, 2025 deadline for actions/cache@v4 migration.

## Implementation Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Basic Caching Setup
1. **Upgraded actions/cache from v3 to v4** in `.github/workflows/main.yml`
   - Required for Feb 2025 deadline compliance

2. **Added Go module caching**:
   - Enabled `cache-dependency-path` in setup-go initially
   - Discovered conflicts with explicit caching
   - Disabled built-in cache (`cache: false`) to use explicit caching
   - Added explicit cache for `~/go/pkg/mod` directory
   - Used version-specific cache keys to prevent version mismatches

3. **Added Rust caching**:
   - Integrated `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for both workflows
   - Configured for `humanlayer-wui/src-tauri` workspace

4. **Added Go tools caching**:
   - Cache for `~/go/bin` directory
   - Includes golangci-lint and mockgen
   - Conditional installation only on cache miss

### Issues Encountered and Fixes

1. **Go Module Cache Corruption**:
   - Error: `could not import sync/atomic (unsupported version: 2)`
   - Caused by Go version mismatch (1.24.5 → 1.24.6)
   - Fixed by:
     - Including Go version in cache key
     - Invalidating cache with `v2` prefix in cache keys

2. **Golangci-lint Compatibility**:
   - v1.61.0 incompatible with Go 1.24.6
   - Updated to v2.1.6 (matches local version)
   - Updated cache keys accordingly

## Current Status

### What's Working:
- ✅ actions/cache upgraded to v4
- ✅ Go module caching implemented (no more "go: downloading" messages on cache hit)
- ✅ Rust caching configured
- ✅ Go tools caching configured

### Current Challenge:
- ❌ Builds still failing with golangci-lint errors
- The sync/atomic import errors persist even after updating golangci-lint
- Latest build: https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/actions/runs/16870255135

## Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
   - Updated actions/cache v3 → v4
   - Added Go module caching with version-specific keys
   - Added Rust caching
   - Added Go tools caching
   - Updated golangci-lint v1.61.0 → v2.1.6

2. `.github/workflows/release-macos.yml`:
   - Added Go module caching
   - Added Rust caching
   - Added Go tools caching

## Cache Keys Structure
- Go modules: `go-mod-v2-${{ runner.os }}-go${{ steps.setup-go.outputs.go-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}`
- Go tools: `go-tools-${{ runner.os }}-golangci-2.1.6-mockgen-0.5`
- Pre-commit: `pre-commit-${{ hashFiles('.pre-commit-config.yaml') }}`

## What's Next

1. **Fix the golangci-lint build failures**:
   - The sync/atomic errors suggest a deeper compatibility issue
   - May need to investigate if golangci-lint v2.1.6 is actually compatible with the codebase
   - Consider checking if there's a different version needed

2. **Verify caching effectiveness**:
   - Once builds pass, verify cache hit rates
   - Measure build time improvements
   - Document results in PR

3. **Update PR description**:
   - Add evidence of caching working (build links)
   - Include metrics on build time improvements
   - Remove branch from workflow triggers before merging

## Useful Commands for Next Agent

```bash
# Check latest workflow run
gh run list --workflow=main.yml --branch=dexter/eng-1758-cache-rust-and-go-compilationdependency-downloads-in-github --limit=1

# View workflow logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log | grep -E "(Cache.*hit|go: downloading|sync/atomic)"

# Check local golangci-lint version
cd hld && golangci-lint version

# Run local checks
make -C hld check
```

- PR: https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/pull/390

## Key Learnings
1. Go's setup-go built-in cache can conflict with explicit caching
2. Cache keys must include Go version to prevent version mismatch errors
3. Corrupted caches need key invalidation (e.g., v1 → v2 prefix)
4. Tool versions must be compatible with Go version used in CI
